# Example of integration in Go (v1.25.1) of a SQLite DB

I started from the book ["Let's Go"](https://lets-go.alexedwards.net/) from Alex Edwards
I converted the mySQL part to SQLite and added the [chinook db](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-sample-database/) from SQLite tutorial

- The CSS part is delegated to [Pico CSS](https://https://picocss.com/)
- [SQLite package](https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3) Go
- Session Manager [SCS](https://github.com/alexedwards/scs/v2)
- [SQLite store](https//github.com/alexedwards/scs/sqlite3store) for sessions
- sessions and users tables added to chinook DB.

## Usage

- You can search on an artists table the albums referenced to this artist.
- The artists.csv file is a CSV dump of the artists table of the DB.
- You must generate your own cert/key pem files to start in https.
